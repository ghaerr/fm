.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple and efficient file browser that gets out of your way
as much as possible.
It was initially implemented to be controlled with a TV remote control.
.Pp
.Nm
defaults to the current directory if
.Ar dir
is not specified.
As an extra feature, if
.Ar dir
is a relative path,
.Nm
will not go back beyond the first component of the path using standard
navigation key presses.
.Pp
.Nm
supports both vi-like and emacs-like key bindings in the default
configuration.
The default key bindings are described below;
their functionality is described in more detail later.

.Sh CONFIGURATION
.Nm
is configured by modifying
.Pa noiceconf.h
and recompiling the code.
.Pp
.Nm
invokes
.Xr nopen 1
to open a file in the user's preferred application.
.Sh FILTERS
Filters allow you to use regexes to display only the matched
entries in the current directory view.
This effectively allows searching through the directory tree
for a particular entry.
.Pp
Filters do not stack on top of each other.
They are applied anew every time.
.Pp
To reset the filter you can input an empty filter expression.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is invoked as root the default filter will also match hidden files.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Ev SHELL ,
.Ev EDITOR
and
.Ev PAGER
environment variables take precedence when dealing with the
.Ic \&! ,
.Ic e
and
.Ic p
commands respectively.
.Pp
The
.Ev NOPEN
environment variable can be used to specify the plumber
program used by
.Nm .
It defaults to
.Xr nopen 1 .
.Sh KNOWN ISSUES
If you are using
.Xr urxvt 1
you might have to set backspace key to DEC.
